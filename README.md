Collexa NetDeploy is a specialized network orchestration tool designed for the Community Core initiative. Built on a clean MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, it bridges the gap between complex scripting and user-friendly operation.

It enables network engineers to bulk-deploy configurations via Jinja2 templates and retrieve operational data into structured Excel reports using smart Regex parsing—all while managing secure access through SSH Jump Hosts automatically.
